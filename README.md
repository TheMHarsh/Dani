# Dani üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

A platform that connects **NGOs** with **donors** for seamless item donations in the same city.

## How It Works

1. **NGOs Post Needs**  
   NGOs create a profile and post their donation needs (e.g., clothes, food).

2. **Donors Browse & Donate**  
   Donors browse needs in their city and select items to donate.

3. **Delivery Integration**  
   Dani uses **Porter API** to arrange pickup and delivery of donations to the NGO.

4. **Complete Donation Process**  
   Donors are notified once the items are successfully delivered.
